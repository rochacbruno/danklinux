# Dank Linux (dms & dankinstall)

A monorepo for dankinstall and dms (cli+go backend), a modern desktop suite for Wayland compositors.

- **dms** DankMaterialShell (cli + go backend)
  - The backend side of dms, provides APIs for the desktop and a management CLI.
  - Shared dbus connection for NetworkManager, loginctl, accountsservice, and other interfaces.
  - Implements various wayland protocols (such as gamma control)
  - Exposes a json API over unix socket for interaction with these interfaces
  - Provides plugin management APIs for the shell
  - Optionally provides `update` interface - depending on build inputs.
    - This is intended to be disabled when packaged as part of distribution packages.
- **dankinstall** Installs the Dank Linux suite for [niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri) and/or [Hyprland](https://hypr.land)
  - Features the [DankMaterialShell](https://github.com/AvengeMedia/DankMaterialShell)
    - Which features a complete desktop experience with wallpapers, auto theming, notifications, lock screen, etc.
  - Offers up solid out of the box configurations as usable, featured starting points.
  - Can be installed if you already have niri/Hyprland configured
    - Will allow you to keep your existing config, or replace with Dank ones (existing configs always backed up though)

# dms cli & backend

A part of the DankMaterialShell, that is provided by this repository. It is written in GO, and exposes a suite of APIs over unix socket that interface with dbus via [godbus](https://github.com/godbus/dbus) and also the plugin system.

**Backend** (all exposed over a unix socket json API):

- **dbus**
  - NetworkManager - full integration with a secrets agent
  - bluez - integration with a pairing agent
  - loginctl - creates sleep inhibitor, integrates lock before suspend, signals for lock/unlock
  - accountsservice - suite of user profile APIs - name, email, profile picture, etc.
- **dms plugins**
  - APIs to browse, install, update, and search available plugins
- **wayland**
  - Implements [wlr-gamma-control-unstable-v1](https://wayland.app/protocols/wlr-gamma-control-unstable-v1)
    - Essentially, provides auto or manual gamma control similar to a tool like [gammastep](https://gitlab.com/chinstrap/gammastep) or [wlsunset](https://github.com/kennylevinsen/wlsunset)

*run `dms debug-srv` to run the socket service in standalone mode, and see a list of available APIs*

**cli**

- manage process: run, restart, kill
- IPC with dms: toggle launcher, notification popup, etc.
- plugins: install/browse/search (use plugin IDs like `dms plugins install myPlugin`)
- update (some builds): Update DMS and dependencies, (disabled for Arch AUR and Fedora copr installs, as it is handled by pacman/dnf)
- greeter (some builds): Install the dms greetd greeter (on arch/fedora it is disabled in favor of OS packages)

## Build & Install

To build the dms CLI (Requires Go 1.24+):

### For distribution package maintainers

This produces a build without the `update` or `greeter` functionality, which are intended for manual installation.

```bash
make dist
```

Produces `bin/dms-linux-amd64` and  `bin/dms-linux-arm64`

### Manual Install

```bash
# Installs to /usr/local/bin/dms
make && sudo make install
```

### Wayland Protocol Bindings

The gamma control functionality uses Wayland protocol bindings generated from the protocol XML definition. To regenerate the Go bindings from `internal/proto/xml/wlr-gamma-control-unstable-v1.xml`:

```bash
go install github.com/rajveermalviya/go-wayland/cmd/go-wayland-scanner@latest
go-wayland-scanner -i internal/proto/xml/wlr-gamma-control-unstable-v1.xml \
  -pkg wlr_gamma_control -o internal/proto/wlr_gamma_control/gamma_control.go
```

This is only needed if modifying the protocol or updating to a newer version.

# Dank Linux/dankinstall

Equivalent to installing "dotfiles", but less intrusive as we don't modify anything on the system besides installing some packages and configuring user-level niri and terminal configurations.

## Quickstart

```bash
curl -fsSL https://install.danklinux.com | sh
```

*Alternatively, download the latest [release](https://github.com/AvengeMedia/danklinux/releases)*

## Supported Distributions

**Note on Greeter**: dankinstall does not install a greeter automatically.
- To install the dms greeter, run `dms greeter install` after installation.
- Then you can disable any existing greeter, if present, and run `sudo systemctl enable --now greetd`

### Arch Linux & Derivatives

**Supported:** Arch, ArchARM, Archcraft, CachyOS, EndeavourOS, Manjaro

**Special Notes:**
- Uses native `pacman` for system packages
- AUR packages are built manually using `makepkg` (no AUR helper dependency)
- **Recommendations**
  - Use NetworkManager to manage networking
  - If using archinstall, you can choose `minimal` for profile, and `NetworkManager` under networking.

**Package Sources:**
| Package | Source | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| System packages (git, jq, etc.) | Official repos | Via `pacman` |
| quickshell | AUR | Built from source |

### Fedora & Derivatives

**Supported:** Fedora, Nobara, Fedora Asahi Remix

**Special Notes:**
- Requires `dnf-plugins-core` for COPR repository support
- Automatically enables required COPR repositories
- All COPR repos are enabled with automatic acceptance
- **Editions** dankinstall is tested on "Workstation Edition", but probably works fine on any fedora flavor. Report issues if anything doesn't work.
- [Fedora Asahi Remix](https://asahilinux.org/fedora/) hasn't been tested, but presumably it should work fine as all of the dependencies should provide arm64 variants.
